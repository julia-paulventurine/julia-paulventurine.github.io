- **Title:** Green Roofs for Urban Flood Mitigation  
  **Authors:** Julia Paul-Venturine, Prof. X, Dr. Y  
  **Abstract:**  
  We quantify how green roof installations alter stormwater runoff in high-density urban districts. Using hydrological modeling (SWMM), field sensors on pilot roofs in City Z, and spatial econometrics on property values, we find a 25 % reduction in peak runoff for medium-intensity storms and estimate up to €2 million/year in avoided flood damage.

- **Title:** Environmental Justice in Housing Markets  
  **Authors:** Julia Paul-Venturine, Dr. A, Dr. B  
  **Abstract:**  
  This project examines whether air‐pollution burdens and green-space access are unequally distributed across income and ethnic groups in Metropolitan Area Q. We pair high-resolution satellite NO₂ data with census tract socio-demographics, employing a difference-in-differences design around policy changes to test for shifts in environmental inequality.

- **Title:** Urban Travel Behavior under Congestion Pricing  
  **Authors:** Julia Paul-Venturine, Prof. C  
  **Abstract:**  
  Analyzing transit smart-card and GPS taxi data before and after congestion-charge implementation in City M, we estimate changes in modal split, trip lengths, and peak‐hour travel times. Early findings suggest a 12 % shift from private cars to public transit during peak periods, with welfare gains of €15 million annually due to reduced travel time and emissions.
