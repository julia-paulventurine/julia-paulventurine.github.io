I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Cologne, funded by the Project ``Housing, Inequality and Public Policy'' supervised by [Sebastian Siegloch](https://sites.google.com/view/siegloch/home).

I am currently completing my PhD jointly at [Paris School of Economics](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu) and [Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne University](https://ed-economie.pantheonsorbonne.fr) under the supervision of [Laurent Gobillon](http://laurent.gobillon.free.fr) (PSE) and [Pierre-Philippe Combes](https://sites.google.com/view/pierrephilippecombes/) (Sciences Po). I'll defend my dissertation in December 2025. 

I’m also an affiliate of the [LIEPP](https://www.sciencespo.fr/liepp/fr/) at Sciences Po.
I was a 2023 [Palladio Foundation](https://fondationpalladio.fr) fellow, and spent Spring 2023 as a visiting scholar at the [Wharton School](https://www.wharton.upenn.edu) of the University of Pennsylvania, sponsored by [Gilles Duranton](https://real-faculty.wharton.upenn.edu/duranton/).

My research interests lie at the intersection between urban economics, environmental economics, and political economy. I use novel GIS data to build causal settings to evaluate how land use regulations shape housing markets in France, with considerations on optimal government levels. While I land use regulations cause major market distorsions, my larger research agenda also focuses how environmental regulations can help cities more resilient to climate change.

You can find my CV [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/cjb5h575ikf9tenfw18m3/CV_JPV___Current.pdf?rlkey=814m3r99fu9ihmz9rchb04yln&st=tx527ate&dl=0)
