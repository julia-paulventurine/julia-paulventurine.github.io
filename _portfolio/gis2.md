After the Second World War, many dwellings were destroyed, and the population was growing very fast, leading to a housing crisis (already!). The solution adopted by the French government was to build "grands ensembles," high-rise buildings that were conceived by architects partly influenced by Le Corbusier. Their mark on the urban structure is very distinguishable: a low land footprint and plenty of open space. The actual population density is similar to that of Haussmannian central Paris. Sometimes, they have interesting shapes, as seen here.
